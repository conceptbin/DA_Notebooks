# Intro to Python Lab Notes
To run the notebooks for this lab, you will need to open them in a working Python 3.9 environment.

You can use any of the following:

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), the standard programming interface for Python, runs in your browser.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): VS Code accommodates dozens of languages, and is widely used in industry. To edit and run notebooks, you will need to install the Jupyter extension.

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): This  is a good option if you have not been able to set up your Python environment locally. For Colab you need to use a Google account and store your files on Google Drive.
