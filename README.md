# DA_Notebooks
Teaching materials for Data Analysis in Python (.ipynb, .py), lab worksheets and sample datasets.

## How to use the notebooks:
We use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to edit and run Python notebooks. Alternatively, you can set up your Python environment locally, but this is not required (or recommended). 

To access Colab you need to have a Google account, so you can copy notebooks and other files to your private space on Google Drive.

How to open a GitHub notebook from within Colab: In a Colab notebook, in the File menu "Open notebook" -> select "GitHub" from the available sources -> enter the URL of this repository. You'll be presented with a list of notebooks available in the repository.
