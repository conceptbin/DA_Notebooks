# DA_Notebooks
Teaching materials for Data Analysis in Python (.ipynb, .py), lab worksheets and sample datasets.

## How to use the notebooks:
You can either run the notebooks locally on your own machine, or open them in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (recommended): 

In a Colab notebook, in the File menu "Open notebook" -> select "GitHub" from the available sources -> enter the URL of this repository. You'll be presented with a list of notebooks available in the repository.
